<p>ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Max.<br/>
Sales/marketing manager by day, with a focus on web marketing;<br/>
  coding enthusiast by night.</p>

<p>(Yeah that means I don't get enough sleep)<br/>
(On the other hand I get to make some tools for myself and my company, so... it's fine I guess?)<br/>
(No seriously, I have a problem, help me)</p>

<p>ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in... pretty much everything.<br/>
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently trying to get better at C# and Unity, I am learning the basics of Python and I am looking forward to learn the basics of C++.</p>
