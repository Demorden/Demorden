<p>👋 Hi, I’m Max.<br/>
Sales/marketing manager by day.<br/>
  Coding enthusiast by night.</p>

<p>(Yeah that means I don't get enough sleep)<br/>
(On the other hand I get to make stuff for myself and my company, so... it's fine I guess?)<br/>

<p>👀 I’m interested in... pretty much everything, from the mating habits of chinchillas to ML.<br/>
  (Not implying I actually know anything valuable about either lol)<br/>
🌱 I’m currently kinda decent (but trying to get better) at C# and Unity, I am learning Python and I am looking forward to study at least the basics of C++.</p>
