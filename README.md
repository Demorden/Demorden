<p>ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Max, aka @Demorden.<br/>
Sales/marketing manager by day, with a focus on web marketing; coding enthusiast by night.</p>

<p>(Yeah that means I don't get enough sleep)<br/>
(On the other hand I get to make some tools for myself and my company, so... it's fine I guess?)<br/>
(No seriously, I have a problem, help me)</p>

<p>ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in HTML5, C# and Unity.<br/>
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C# and Unity, looking forward to learn the basics of python and C++.</p>
