<p>ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Max.<br/>
Sales/marketing manager by day,coding enthusiast by night.</p>

<p>(Yeah that means I don't get enough sleep)<br/>
(On the other hand I get to make stuff for myself and my company, so... it's fine I guess?)<br/>

<p>ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in... pretty much everything, from the mating habits of chinchillas to ML.<br/>
  <i>(Not implying I actually know anything valuable about either lol)</i><br/></p>
<p>ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently kinda decent at C# (mostly Unity), learning Python and looking forward to study at least the basics of C++.</p>
