<p>ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Max.<br/>
<p>I mostly do stuff in Unity and C#, and I'm learning Python. I plan to learn C++ eventually, at least the basics. I am also kinda able to mess around with php and js, but I'm not really proficient in either of those.</p>
<p>But considering I'm a salesman, I guess that's fine lol.</p>
