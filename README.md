<p>ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Max.<br/>
Sales/marketing manager by day.<br/>
  Coding enthusiast by night.</p>

<p>(Yeah that means I don't get enough sleep)<br/>
(On the other hand I get to make stuff for myself and my company, so... it's fine I guess?)<br/>
(No seriously, I have a problem, help me)</p>

<p>ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in... pretty much everything.<br/>
ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently kinda decent (but trying to get better) at C# and Unity, I am learning Python and I am looking forward to study at least the basics of C++.</p>
